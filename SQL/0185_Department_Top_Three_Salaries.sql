A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write an SQL query to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.


Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
Output: 
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation: 
In the IT department:
- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:
- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees


Solution 01 (MySQL):

Approach: Using JOIN and sub-query [Accepted]
Algorithm

A top 3 salary in this company means there is no more than 3 salary bigger than itself in the company.

select e1.Name as 'Employee', e1.Salary
from Employee e1
where 3 >
(
    select count(distinct e2.Salary)
    from Employee e2
    where e2.Salary > e1.Salary
)
;
In this code, we count the salary number of which is bigger than e1.Salary. So the output is as below for the sample data.

| Employee | Salary |
|----------|--------|
| Henry    | 80000  |
| Max      | 90000  |
| Randy    | 85000  |
Then, we need to join the Employee table with Department in order to retrieve the department information.

MySQL

SELECT
    d.Name AS 'Department', e1.Name AS 'Employee', e1.Salary
FROM
    Employee e1
        JOIN
    Department d ON e1.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE
    3 > (SELECT
            COUNT(DISTINCT e2.Salary)
        FROM
            Employee e2
        WHERE
            e2.Salary > e1.Salary
                AND e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
        )
;
